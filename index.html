    <h1>Identifying Targets For Effective Food Access Policy</h1>

    <div class="article">
        <p>Food deserts are regions where low-income individuals have limited access to fresh food. Typically food deserts are lacking in grocery stores which provide access to fruits and vegetables at affordable prices, leading low-income individuals to rely on fast-food or convenience stores for most of their meals. This reliance is correlated with poor health outcomes from substandard nutrition. Food deserts are not just a peculiarity of geographic food distribution, they are strongly related to socioeconomic status disproportionately impacting demographic minority groups.</p>
        <p>Let’s better understand what a food desert is and where they can be found. A food desert is an area of low access which may fall into three tiers of access based on distance. According to the U.S Department of Agriculture, a low access areas are ”Low-income census tracts where a significant number (at least 500 people) or share (at least 33 percent) of the population is greater than one-half mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store for an urban area or greater than 10 miles for a rural area.” for the loosest category up to 1 mile in urban areas and 20 miles in rural areas in the worst case. </p>
        <p>This distinction in definition for urban and rural food deserts by geographic distribution point to key differences in terms of access to fresh food. While both urban and rural food deserts are connected to socioeconomic challenges, they are distinct in the spatial impact. Urban food deserts are typically defined as regions where people are located more than half a mile to a mile from the nearest large grocery store, making the issue one of convenience and accessibility versus non-healthy alternatives. Urban food deserts often occur in areas where there is a significant minority population, but the number of grocery stores is insufficient to meet the demand.</p>
        <p>In contrast, rural food deserts are characterized by the sheer magnitude of distances away from a major grocery store. The issue here isn’t necessarily the density of stores, given already sparse populations, but rather that large distance between homes and stores. This distance is especially challenging given the general lack of public transportation options in rural regions, making it difficult for residents to travel the long distances to access fresh food. Additionally, in rural areas, economic opportunities are often more limited, and many people rely on personal vehicles to access services, which may not be feasible for low-income families.</p>

        <p>The geographic distribution of food deserts reveals a complex pattern, where both urban and rural communities face access issues, but these issues manifest differently based on factors such as population density, transportation infrastructure, and demographic factors. What’s clear is that food deserts are deeply intertwined with systemic inequalities in income, transportation, and urban planning. </p>
        <p>The map above shows that the vast majority of the populated regions of the United States have a greater share of the Urban population living in a food desert than the Rural population county by county. High impact policy would target these Urban food deserts but to be effective, it is essential to understand who makes up residents in these food low access regions.</p>

    <h1>How Does Food Desert Status Affect Different Racial Groups In Urban And Rural Areas?</h1>
    <div class="article">
        <p>
            The previous geospatial analysis tells us that food deserts are particularly prevalent in urban areas, 
            but does belonging to different racial groups in these areas affect their access to fresh food? 
            To answer this question, we can compare the low food acess population for different racial groups in urban and rural areas.
            Having such an analysis would help policy makers to make targeted interventions to address the food insecurity problem in these areas for different racial groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scatter plot below shows the percentage of low food access population for different racial groups in different states. 
            The y-axis represents the percentage of low food access population, normalized by the total population of each state and racial group. 
            The x-axis represents the percentage of urban population in each state and racial group. 
            Each point on the scatter plot represents a specific racial group for a specific state. The size of the point corresponds to the absolute low access population for that racial group in that state.
            The color of each point represents the racial group, including White (blue), Black (orange), Asian (green), and Hispanic (purple).
            The legend on the right side of the scatter plot shows the color coding for each racial group.

    <div class="article">
        <p>
            The above visualization shows a clear positive correlation between the percentage of low food access population and the percentage of urban population in each state and racial group.
            This reaffirms the first visualization's conclusion that urban food deserts are more prevalent than rural food deserts in the United States. 
            Interestingly, the visualization also shows that the percentage of low food access population varies drastically across different racial groups even in the same state. 
            This can be seen by hovering over each point on the scatter plot, which displays a tooltip with a breakdown of racial groups' percentage of low food access population in that state.
            This variation suggests that when making policies to address food insecurity on the national level, it is important to target different racial groups based on their unique needs and circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the visualization also reveals a consistent different in terms of the percent of urban to rural population in each state's racial groups. 
            In particular, on average, the minority groups (Black, Asian, and Hispanic) have a higher percentage of urban population in the states they live in compared to the majority groups (White). 
            This thesis suggests that the urban-rural divide in food deserts is not only a geographic one, but also a socioeconomic one, 
            and that the policies and programs that target to address the urban food insecurity problems should be tailored to the minority racial groups, such as providing affordable food access, 
            increase cultural food opportunities, and support community-based food security options such as farmer's markets, restaurants, and community gardens.

    <h1>How Effective is SNAP at Addressing Food Access in High-Poverty Areas?</h1>
    <h3> Food Desert Status vs. Poverty Rate by County</h3>
    <div class="article">
        <p>
            <p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) represents one of America's primary defenses against food insecurity, providing crucial financial assistance to millions of low-income households. However, our visualization reveals a complex and sometimes counterintuitive relationship between SNAP participation and food desert status. The distribution of counties across poverty rates shows that areas designated as food deserts often have higher SNAP participation rates, indicated by darker blue shading in our visualization, particularly in regions with poverty rates between 20% and 40%.</p>
            <p>The size of each bubble in our visualization, representing county population, adds another crucial dimension to understanding food access challenges. Larger urban counties frequently appear as food deserts despite having high SNAP participation rates, suggesting that financial assistance alone cannot overcome structural barriers to food access. This pattern is particularly evident in California's urban centers, where we observe clusters of large, dark blue bubbles in both food desert and non-food desert categories.
            In urban areas, the paradox becomes even more striking. Counties with high population density often show high SNAP participation rates (darker blue coloring) yet remain classified as food deserts. This contradiction challenges the assumption that urban areas, with their presumably better infrastructure and higher population density, naturally provide better food access. Instead, it suggests that urban food deserts persist due to complex factors beyond mere distance to grocery stores, including transportation barriers, economic disinvestment, and retail market dynamics.
            Smaller counties, represented by smaller bubbles in our visualization, tell a different but equally concerning story. These areas often display lighter blue coloring, indicating lower SNAP participation rates, regardless of their food desert status.</p> <p>This pattern raises important questions about program accessibility and stigma in rural communities. Are eligible residents facing barriers to enrollment? Do smaller communities face unique challenges in implementing and utilizing SNAP benefits?</p>    
        </p>

    <div id="bubble-container"></div>
        <script type="module">
            import define from "./bubble.js";
            import {Runtime, Inspector} from "./runtime.js";
            const runtime = new Runtime();
            const main = runtime.module(define, Inspector.into(document.querySelector("#bubble-container")));
        </script>
    <!-- <div class="article">

    <div id="bubble-container"></div>
    <div class="article">
        <p>
            <p>Examining the distribution along the poverty rate axis reveals another crucial pattern: as poverty rates increase, we see a higher concentration of counties classified as food deserts. However, this relationship isn't purely linear. Some counties with relatively lower poverty rates still qualify as food deserts, while others with higher poverty rates do not, suggesting that local factors beyond economic indicators play a crucial role in determining food access.
            The implications of these patterns extend beyond immediate food access. Communities where high SNAP participation coexists with food desert status may face compounded health challenges. While SNAP benefits provide the means to purchase food, the limited availability of fresh, nutritious options in food deserts may force residents to rely on less healthy alternatives, potentially contributing to poor health outcomes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The visualization helps us understand both the successes and limitations of SNAP as a food security program. The high participation rates in many food desert areas indicate that the program is reaching many communities in need. However, the persistent classification of these areas as food deserts suggests that SNAP benefits alone cannot overcome structural barriers to food access.
            Our analysis reveals that addressing food desert challenges requires a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach that goes beyond simple SNAP benefit distribution. The visualization demonstrates that even areas with high SNAP participation often remain classified as food deserts, pointing to deeper structural issues that require targeted solutions. To effectively combat food access inequities, communities need coordinated interventions 
            across four key areas: enhanced infrastructure development through public-private partnerships and community food hubs, improved transportation solutions including last-mile delivery options, strengthened SNAP program outreach particularly in rural areas, and robust community-based initiatives such as farmers' markets and nutrition education programs. These interventions, when implemented together, can create sustainable food environments 
            that better serve all community members, particularly in areas where high SNAP participation alone hasn't resolved persistent food access challenges.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The patterns revealed in our visualization underscore the need for a multi-faceted approach to addressing food access challenges. While SNAP provides crucial assistance, lasting solutions must address the underlying structural issues that create and perpetuate food deserts. This requires coordinated effort across government agencies, private sector partners, and community organizations to create sustainable, equitable food systems that serve all communities effectively.</p>
